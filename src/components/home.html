                <p class="hero-para">The Department seeks to enchance the student's understanding of scientific principles and to further develop their technical skills by hands-on designing and testing of electronics circuits and systems similar to those used in industry. The proposed syllabus has been designed to cater to the needs of the hour. The contents are such, that the passing out students will be more useful for the society, industry and related jobs. The Application Courses (AC) will provide hands on training experience (like PCB design, Embedded systems, and relevant computer related languages). Besides this Research Methodology, Project and Dissertation will add to their experimental and theoretical skills. </p>
                <p class="hero-para">In addition to it all the 4 AC papers will essentially provide instruction cum lab for hands on experience of the subject-i.e. 3 hours for each paper per week. All these papers will be taught by teachers of department of electronics in each college. In VII & VIII semesters the research and project work will be done under the guidance of the teachers of electronics department in each college. In the academic year 2012-13, an Electronic Automation Center (EAC) was started to facilitate inquiry centered learning. In this students are encouraged to design various innovative electronic devices and package them in the Mechanical Automation Center (MAC) situated in the college premises. Under the Teaching Aids Development Program, students design various teaching aids helpful towards visual understanding of concepts as well as being highly cost effective. The student's society TECHNO organizes workshops and various co-curricular activities all through the year. </p>
                <p class="hero-para">The mission of the Department is, to develop human potential fully so that intellectually capable and imaginatively gifted leaders can emerge in a range of professions, to develop academic integrity and accountability, to train and develop students to be good and able citizens, capable of making significant contribution towards meeting the developmental needs and priorities of the Nation and to inculcate in students moral values and leadership qualities, such that they shall always uphold and promote a high social order and be ready and willing to work for the emancipation of the poor, the needy and the under-privileged. The department is proud to have highly qualified, experienced and highly dedicated faculty. All the faculty members are equally passionate about their research and teaching. They are keen to bring the excitement of discovery to the classroom and to involve the students in research. Their research interests ranges from Nanotechnology to the beginning of the universe. Many of them have worked at some of the leading international research and academic institutions and continue to be involved in collaborative research with these institutions.
                The main motive of the faculty members is to inculcate a sense of logical and scientific reasoning amongst their students.
